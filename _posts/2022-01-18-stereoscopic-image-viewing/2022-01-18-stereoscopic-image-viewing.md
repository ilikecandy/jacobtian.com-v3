Try it now!

You might have seen a 3D movie at the movie theatre with special glasses, or those red and blue anaglyph 3D glasses. There is actually a method where you can see images in 3D without any glasses right on your phone or computer screen! This method is known as stereoscopy, where it creates the illusion of depth. I found this concept very fascinating and I highly recommend you to try it! There are two methods for viewing without any equipment; parallel and cross. They both involve 'combining' two perspectives into one image that will appear to have depth. This is also used in the Magic Eye series of books, which uses parallel viewing.

## How to: Cross Viewing method
Cross viewing is my preferred method of viewing, as it is quite easy to do once you get the hang of it! It requires you to cross your eyes, then slowly let go until perfectly aligned, which switches the sides of the two images (see diagram). Cross viewing images have the left view on the right side, and the right view on the left side so it will be viewed normal when crossed. You will know if you have crossed your eyes too far if you start seeing four images. There is no max size of the photos (unlike with parallel viewing), so you can see more detail on a bigger screen. This method is better than parallel viewing if you can easily cross your eyes.

## How to: Parallel Viewing method
Parallel viewing (sometimes called wall-eyed viewing) only works well if you are far from the image or the image is very small on the screen. I found it easier to view parallel on a phone or smaller screen. It's helpful to start by looking at a far object, then bring your eyes down. Parallel view images have each view on the corresponding side.

## Example photos

If you view a photo meant for parallel view using the cross view method or vice versa, you may see reverse depth (pseudoscopic effect).

## How to take Photos for Cross or Parallel View

Stereoscopic photos are just two of the same photo, just with one that is slightly shifted to the left or right. You can use any camera, like a phone and simply take two photos with one shifted, then combine them with any basic image manipulating software. You can also use two cameras side by side, so the photos can be more consistent. An easy way to take them is to use an app, like CrossCam for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crosscam/id1436262905) and [Android]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kra2008.crosscam), which simplifies the editing process, and the app also has a helpful and detailed tutorial.

## The Crossing Point
With either viewing technique, you can also view hidden messages and almost instantly find all the differences in those 'spot the difference' games!![r/CrossView - Hidden message?](https://preview.redd.it/9y0bb6pjc9my.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=725759f31a62b23c85e0519c1d589e8d4b1e5cdf)![img](https://cdn.womenworking.com/440813/uploads/79780560-9b71-11ea-a718-23cc54526919_800_420.jpeg)

I hope you found this cool and interesting and were able to view at least one of the images in 3D! You might strain your eyes if you cross them for too long. This won't cause any long term harm, but it's a good idea to take a break once in a while!
