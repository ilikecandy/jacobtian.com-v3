# The Recipe

Here's the full recipe right here (backstory and details at the end, thank me later! ðŸ˜›)

---

# Ingredients:

<style>
   input, label{ display: inline; }

   p em, img + em { font-size: 1.2em; display: block; }
</style>

The yield of the recipe is 12 muffins, which Iâ€™m already satisfied with
If I wanted to make 18 muffins, I would need to multiply every ingredient by (18 / 12) which is 1.5

Specify yield to get the ingredients!

# Directions:

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F

2. Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners or spray with non-stick cooking spray.

3. Whisk the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.

4. In another bowl, whisk the melted coconut oil, mashed banana, egg, and vanilla until blended

5. Add the banana mixture to the bowl with dry ingredients then use a fork to combine. (Only mix until combined, try not to beat the batter too much. This will make the baked muffins dense)
   
   If the batter seems too thick or dry, stir in a tablespoon or two of water or milk. Fold in the blueberries.

6. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake until a toothpick can be inserted and comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

# Final evaluation
It was delicious! Sweet, but not too sweet. The texture was soft and fluffy, like a muffin should be. I could see the banana lines inside as well as green-purple spots of the blueberries! Overall, I would say it was a success. I will definitely make this again, and I recommend it to anyone who likes muffins.

It's very customizable, so you can create variations as you please (if you don't like blueberries, for example, but how could you not?). Once again, I did not have whole wheat flour, so I substituted it for all purpose flour instead.

I didn't make any mistakes, but I did learn a few things. I learned that it's important to measure the ingredients correctly and to not overfill the cups, as I got exactly enough batter for exactly 12 with none that overflowed.

I also recommend it to anyone who doesn't know a whole lot about baking. It's a simple recipe that doesn't require a lot of ingredients (nothing too specific), and it's easy to follow. I will definitely be making this again, but I would maybe lower the sugar, and add more blueberries.

I hope you enjoyed this post, and I hope you try this recipe out! If you do, please let me know how it goes in the comments! (make sure to OVERLOAD one muffin with blueberries like I did!) I would love to hear your feedback. Thank you for reading this far, and have a great day! :)

# Some notes on photo compression!
The photos for this blog post were in .jpeg from a phone, and the total for the 47 photos were 130 MB.
I converted them to .webp, and the total for the 47 photos were 29.9 MB, which is a 77% reduction in size!
While the quality is not as good as .jpeg, it is still very good (enough for a blog post), and the size is much smaller.

I also take photos in HEIC format, which  saves space, and doesn't lose quality. However, it is not suitable for web use, because it is not supported by devices.
