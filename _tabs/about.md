Hello there! I'm Jacob Tian, a Grade 11 student passionate about photography, 3D printing + design, and programming. 

The camera I use is the Canon EOS Rebel SL3, with the Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 and Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 lenses. I take pictures of pretty much everything, including portraits, landscapes, nature, macro, and astrophotography.

I also sell 3D printed cookie cutters on Etsy, check them out [here](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/NovelCookies)! 

Thank you for visiting!
